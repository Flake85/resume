# resume
This is a project I started out of boredom. I made this to focus on code
organization and to learn the basics of vue-router. Eventually I will go
on to add a vuex store to get rid of passing props and make it to if you 
leave the /creator page and return, it will store data in the store. I 
continue to update as I learn new stuff and apply as needed. Hopefully 
this will peak interest and I can use this as my resume'. Thanks for 
taking a peak at the few things I have learned! -Flechas
